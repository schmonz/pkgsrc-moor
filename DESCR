Moor is a pager. It reads and displays UTF-8 encoded text from files or
pipelines. Moor should be trivial to get into if you have previously
been using Less.

`moor` is designed to just do the right thing without any configuration:

- Syntax highlight source code by default using Chroma
- Search is incremental / find-as-you-type just like in Chrome or Emacs
- Filtering is incremental: Press & to filter the input interactively
- Search becomes case sensitive if you add any UPPER CASE characters
- Regexp search if your search string is a valid regexp
- Snappy UI even on slow / large input by reading input in the
  background and using multi-threaded search
- Supports displaying ANSI color coded texts (like the output from git
  diff | riff for example)
- Supports UTF-8 input and output
- Transparent decompression when viewing compressed text files (.gz,
  .bz2, .xz, .zst, .zstd) or streams
- The position in the file is always shown
- Supports word wrapping (on actual word boundaries) if requested using
  --wrap or by pressing w
- Follows output as long as you are on the last line, just like tail -f
- Renders terminal hyperlinks properly
- Mouse Scrolling works out of the box (but look here for tradeoffs)
